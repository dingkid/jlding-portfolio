        <h2>OINGO BOINGO</h2>
        <p>"Oingo Boingo" Is a 1lb Plastic Ant (PlAnt) combat bot that was named minutes before its battle.
            This was a collaborative effort with Ian Bhatt, Albert Lin, and Peter Molzer, members of the Northeastern Combat Robotics team.<br>
            The design process began on a collaborative OnShape file. Here, I assisted with the weapon motor shell part of the robot.</p>
