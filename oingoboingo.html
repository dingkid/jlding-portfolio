        <p>"Oingo Boingo" Is a 1lb Plastic Ant (PlAnt) combat bot that was named minutes before its battle.
            This was a collaborative effort with Ian Bhatt, Albert Lin, and Peter Molzer, and the first ever robotics project I have ever worked on.<br>
            The design process began on a collaborative OnShape file. This design uses two wheels, and two "legs" to keep it upright.
            The horizontal propeller is dense, and serves as the weapon. All electronics are stored inside the chassis.<br>

            Here, I assisted with the weapon motor shell part of the robot (in blue blelow), and thinning the walls to reduce 
            the weight of the chassis when it was ever so slightly over 1lb.
