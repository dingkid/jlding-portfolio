        <h2>SPINNY BOI 3000</h2>
        <p>The Spinny Boi 3000 is a combat robot designed to compete in the NHRL 3lb weight class, and was created primarily by Albert Lin and Peter Molzer. 
            However, I occassionally help out with it and have attended all of its matches so far (one).<br>
            This project started in fall of 2024, and is inspired by Event Horizon, another ring spinner made by a few friends on the Northeastern Combat Robotics team 
            which has been an ongoing project for a couple of years now.<br><br>
            The spinner design allows its weapon to serve as armor, and honestly just looks pretty cool.
            Even though Spinny Boi is in the 3lb weight class, its omni-shuffler drive as an alternative mode of movement allows for an extra pound of weight (based on NHRL rules).<br>
            <img src="#" class="center project-image">
            Instead of wheels, the robot uses three shufflers containing several strips of small "teeth" that push the robot forward. 
            The omni-drive system allows the robot to translate in three directions along with the ability to rotate freely. <br><br>
            While I am not the main contributor to this project, I have helped by sanding down some parts and squaring stock on a manual mill in preparation for waterjetting. 
            During meets, I'm able to assist with assembling and disassembling the robot for repairs. I am also the designated driver when traveling to meets (I haven't needed to yet, but April 5th, here we come).

            Spinny Boi competed at an MIT collegiate battle bots tournament in December 2024 and, ironically, was up againast its inspiration Event Horizon. Watch its first-ever battle <a target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Va1UtsipezQ?t=21260">here</a><br>

            As this is an ongoing project, I will keep this page updated on progress and the outcome of our matches.
