  <h3>About Me:</h3>
  <p>
    I'm Jessica "Jay" Ding, a third year (out of five) majoring in mechanical engineering and minoring in mathematics at Northeastern University.
    Currently at Northeastern, I am a part of the Combat Robotics Team and Digital Illustration Association.<br>
    I am a pretty avid violist. In high school. I played viola in the Boston Youth Symphony and Boston Philharmonic Youth Orchestra. 
    In college, I play for the NU symphony orchestra and in a chamber group.
    In my freetime, I enjoy making digital artwork (ranging from simple sketches to finished paintings), knitting, playing rhythm games, inline skating, and riding my longboard poorly around the city. <br>
    Growing up as an artist and creator, I would like my future work to be hands-on. However, as someone who is new to to the MechE world, I am open to all experiences in the field, hoping I can contribute with my knowledge in this discipline as well as others and learn a lot of new things.<br>
    If you would like to contact me, feel free to email me at the address at the bottom of the page (most preferred), or message me on LinkedIn.
